## Feature Summary

Users who register for an account can broadcast short 280-character messages to the site-wide global timeline.  Each user has a unique username, called a handle, and a profile page with a log of their messages.  Users can follow other users to customize what messages they see in their personal feed.  Users have the ability to duplicate or "re-Tweet" any message onto their own timeline with an optional comment.  Prefixing a word with the pound or hashtag (#) symbol makes the term searchable by other users.  Users can also search for other users by their handle or search for tweets by keyword.  Optional cookies are used for persistent user sessions.

This application is optimized to scale as the load of users increase.  Caching, multi-threading, and a lightweight NoSQL database are employed to manage scalability problems.
